## About the Game

Mancala is a generic name for a family of two-player turn-based strategy board games played with small stones, beans, or seeds and rows of holes or pits in the earth, a board or other playing surface. The objective of the game is usually to capture more seeds than the opponent.

O An Quan (meaning "Mandarin Square Capturing") is a traditional Vietnamese mancala game that has been played for centuries. It is a game of strategy and calculation that can be played by people of all ages.

## Game Rules

The rules of O An Quan are simple yet challenging. Each player has seven small pits and one big pit, called "mancala", on their side of the board. The objective is to capture more seeds than the opponent.
